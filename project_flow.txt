1. use cookiecutter for template
2. update/delete the files and folder if require inside src
3. initializing the git at local
3. create git hub repo with same name and add remote repo with local and push the existing files 
4. connect dagshub with github repo and copy the experiment_id and other required code
5. create the dagshub_setup.py inside notebooks folder and setup dagshub
-------plan of project---
we have tweet emotion data,first we will apply BoW and TfIdf with algoriths like logisticRegression,
RandomForest, Xgb, etc which ever combination give good result, we take that combination and run
hyperparameter tuining on that combination then use dvc pipeline and register the model.
exp1- Bow + algos 
exp2- TfIdf + algos
exp3- hyperparameter tuning with best combination
These experiments will be written in jupyterNotebook and tracked by dagshub

6. In exp-1 , we used jupyternotebook to perform the experiment and tracked in dagshub using mlflow. here we run the logisticRegression Baseline model
7. In exp-2 , we perform apply Bow and Tfidf as preprocessing and apply different models and find Bow and LoR is having better accuracy(f1 score).
so, we will choose it and apply hyperparameter tuning at this combination. although, we can try hyperparameter tuning with all combination
